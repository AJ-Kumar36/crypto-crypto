    <p>
      Caesar cipher is fun, but it generally is easy to break. For each message, there are only 26 variations, so if you have enough time,
      you could decrypt any message sent via Caesar cipher.

    <p>
      If you had a computer, you could make a program that would quickly list out all 26 combinations, so the Caesar cipher is a very weak
      cipher. Instead, let's look at a stronger cipher.
